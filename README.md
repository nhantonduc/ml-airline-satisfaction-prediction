# Airline Satisfaction Prediction

This project aims to analyze and predict passenger satisfaction with airline services using machine learning techniques. The system leverages data analysis and predictive modeling to help airlines improve customer experience and identify key factors influencing satisfaction.

## Features

- **Data Analysis**: Comprehensive analysis of airline customer satisfaction data.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Predict customer satisfaction using supervised learning techniques.
- **Feature Engineering**: Process and refine key attributes to enhance model accuracy.
- **Visualization**: Generate insights through clear and actionable visualizations.

## Technology Stack

- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook

## Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/airline-satisfaction-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd airline-satisfaction-prediction
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
